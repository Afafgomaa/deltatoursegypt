			<strong> 1. Is Egypt safe to visit, especially after the political events that took place after the Egyptian Revolution?</strong><br>
			-Tourists have been visiting Egypt for centuries and Egyptians have well-earned reputation for warmth and kindness toward visitors. Egyptian cities are generally very safe, especially in area where tourists frequent.
			-Since the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, there has been intermittent unrest and political violence in Egypt, but even the most intense episodes have occurred in a relatively small area of Cairo and other cities. Tourist sites, mostly located far from these areas, have not been affected and there is no negative feeling toward foreign visitors among Egyptians. While Egypt is certainly still dealing with a political transition, it has not significantly affected the experience of tourists in the country.<br>

			-Delta  Tours has only rarely had to even slightly adjust tour itineraries to avoid protests and there has never been an instance when our clients were in danger. Most of our clients rave these days about how safe they felt during their trip. <br>


			<strong>2. Is Egypt considered a safe destination in comparison to other countries in the world?</strong> <br>
			- Egypt generally has a very low crime rate. Travelers will be safe in Egypt if they take sensible precautions that would apply to any tourist destination around the world.

			-There are many touristic areas in Egypt where special concerns are not necessary; however, in less touristic places, relatively modest dress is recommended. Women should avoid very tight clothing, keep their shoulders and knees covered, and avoid very revealing necklines. Men should also avoid particularly revealing clothing as all Egyptians generally dress more modestly than in many parts of Europe and America. For instance, wearing shorts is not very common among Egyptians. Dressing with relative modesty is a way of respecting the local culture.
			Please Note that Women should cover their arms and legs while visiting mosques and churches.

		<p>
			Due to the low salaries of many professionals in Egypt, many people depend on tips, or baksheesh as it is called in Egypt, as a major part of their income. Therefore, tipping is considered customary in Egypt.

			- The amount depends on the Services provided . In a restaurant, it is good to give between 5 and 10% tip directly to the waiter even when there is service added to the bill. <br>
			For a small favor, like carrying luggage or parking a car, a few Egyptian pounds would be appropriate. Not more than five. Often times in Egypt you will find someone tending to the bathroom to keep it clean. Giving them one Egyptian pound is an appropriate amount.
			- Tour guides also usually accept tips. Fifty to 100 Egyptian pounds per day <br>
			Drivers of the vehicles during your tours in Egypt  expect tips as well.

			Taxis and Limousines are widely available in all major cities in Egypt; however, there are many less expensive alternatives in most cities, e.g. Subway, Metros, Trains, and Buses. It is not advisable to use taxis in traveling between cities, as Planes, Buses, and trains are accessible for a modest fee.
			Buses:
			Street buses are a basic, but a cheap means of getting around. Buses between cities are of a higher standard, and have bathroom, Videos, central air-condition and a waitress service onboard for longer trips.
			Trains:
			On day trains it is well worth paying the extra for First Class, still very reasonably priced. The seats are comfortable, reclining, almost like flying first class on a plane. There is a trolley wait service for snacks, sandwiches and drinks. The night sleeper trains are owned by Carlson Wagon lit and are quite comfortable. Beds are one up and one down bunk beds. Adjoining carriages are available for families. An adequate dinner and breakfast are served directly to the cabin as part of the price. Drinks with the meals are not included other than coffee with breakfast. There is a wash sink in each cabin, toilets at the end of each carriage. Luggage is stored overhead in your cabin.
			Metro:
			In Cairo: Efficient, well organized, and runs to a strict timetable, well worth using if the train goes to areas where you want to travel.
			Nile Water Buses:
			Fast and cheap for crossing the Nile or going to the areas covered by the bus.
